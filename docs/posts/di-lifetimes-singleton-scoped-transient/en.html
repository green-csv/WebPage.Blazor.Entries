<h1>Understanding Dependency Injection Lifetimes in .NET: Singleton, Scoped &amp; Transient</h1>
<p>Modern applications rely on decoupled components and clear separation of concerns. At the heart of this lies <strong>Inversion of Control (IoC)</strong>—the idea that you hand off the responsibility for creating and managing object lifetimes to an external container or framework. <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> is a concrete pattern for implementing IoC: you declare your dependencies, and the container wires them up for you.</p>
<p>ASP NET Core’s built-in DI container takes this a step further by offering three distinct <strong>lifetimes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Singleton</strong>: one instance for the entire application</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scoped</strong>: one instance per logical operation (e.g. per HTTP request)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transient</strong>: a new instance every time it’s requested</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these lifetimes is crucial for building efficient, maintainable, and thread-safe services—especially when working with resources like database contexts, HTTP clients, or long-running background jobs.</p>
<p>Understanding these lifetimes is only the first step. Behind them lies a rich landscape of design patterns, best practices, and advanced container features (Seemann &amp; van Deursen, 2019)[^1]. If you’re intrigued by how DI shapes modular, testable, and maintainable codebases, dive into the full article for practical examples and deeper insights into IoC, constructor injection, and lifetime management (Fowler, 2004)[^2].</p>
